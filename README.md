# Aurora — test build, 5 October 2026

Test app: https://keidsolo24.github.io/aura-app/

Phone and desktop: launch screen → tutorial → first-time setup → Home, Spaces, Board and Plan. Existing local setup goes straight to the app after tapping the logo.

Open Settings → account/sync. Create an account and confirm the email once, or sign in to an existing account. Use the same account on both devices. Guest mode saves only on the current device.

This test uses `aurora_test_state_v13` and `aurora_test_commit_v13` with account-scoped row-level security. Older schema-6 cloud data remains in its original table; it is not automatically imported into this clean test. Media uses the existing private `aurora-media` bucket, with multipart transfer for large files. Do not put administrative keys in this static site.

The mobile and desktop tutorial soundtracks use the supplied K9 beat, mastered quietly. User-selected card colours remain available. The old purple and green background choices have been removed.

All files in this release folder belong in the repository root. Relative paths work under the GitHub Pages repository URL. `supabase-test-v13.sql` documents the additive backend setup already applied for this release. Build source is maintained in the local Aurora workspace.

English is the default interface language. Choose Czech in Settings → Language; the choice stays on this device. User-written card names, notes and other content are never translated. The tutorial video is in English.

Testing: automated first-run/resume/returning flows, responsive layouts, simulated two-device sync, offline recovery, media round-trip, large-media chunk verification. Physical iOS/Android and real email delivery still need user acceptance testing.
